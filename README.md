# TheBrewingProject
A complete rewrite of BreweryX to add new features and expand upon the plugin.

### Announcement from TheBrewingProject [discord](https://discord.gg/QsDKaruwcC):

# If you are a Java and/or Kotlin developer, please read

I'm looking to assemble a team of developers to rewrite Brewery. While I still plan to maintain BreweryX unless this plan comes to fruition, Brewery is an extremely old plugin with it being over a decade old now. 'DieReicheEtherons', the group consisting of **TTTheKing, Grafe, and Sn0wStorm**, have made poor code choices over the years which now hurts this project and especially me as a solo developer maintaining BreweryX. The old developers of this plugin are long gone, and while I have gotten familiar with this projects code, it's incredibly bad overall and spending hours cleaning up messes left behind by the original developers has been frustrating at times.

If you are a Java and/or Kotlin developer, please message me if you'd like to be onboard with this project. If you are a server owner who has benefited from BreweryX and has a team with Java/Kotlin developers on it, please refer them to this discord. I don't have the time to rewrite Brewery alone, and I don't want Brewery to fizzle out due to being virtually unmaintainable because of it's poor code. If you're neither of those, leave a star on the [repository](https://github.com/Jsinco/BreweryX) or consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/Jsinco).

I would very much like to rewrite Brewery to add new features, and overall give the plugin a long overdue makeover.
