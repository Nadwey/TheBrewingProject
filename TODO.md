### TODO/ideas

- Quality shouldn't be hardcoded to be only 0 to 5, not sure how this could be implemented
- ~~Fancier external plugin ingredient api (mainly to support Nova)~~.  
    My Nova addon got pushed to backlog, but I would still want the `api` package to be less dependent on Spigot API.
- Comments that don't suck

That's all for now...
