### Cool stuff that I came up with? (to discuss)

- Quality shouldn't be hardcoded to be only 0 to 5, but not sure how this could be implemented
- ~~Fancier external plugin ingredient api (mainly to support Nova)~~.  
    The Nova addon got pushed to backlog, but I would still want the `api` package to be less dependent on Spigot API.
- Decide if we really need support for version 1.20.4. I feel like supporting both 1.20.4 and 1.20.5+ will be a significant hassle and likely won't be worth the effort.  
    A lot of servers [are already on newer versions](https://bstats.org/global/bukkit#minecraftVersion)

That's all for now...
